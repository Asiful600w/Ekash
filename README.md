# eKash – Mobile Financial Services App

eKash is a simplified Mobile Financial Services (MFS) application designed to enhance usability, security, and accessibility for users in Bangladesh. The project was initially developed as part of my undergraduate thesis:

The app focuses on providing a secure, user-friendly, and localized experience (English & Bangla) for mobile transactions such as send money, cash out, mobile recharge, and payments.
